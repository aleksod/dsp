[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> I used `CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)` in order to investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. The value for Cohen d in this case is -.089, indicating that first babies are lighter than others. Since Cohen d for pregnancy length was 0.029, first births are longer than others. The difference is more noticeable for the weight of the babies rather than for the pregnancy length due to the absolute magnitude of Cohen d for weights being larger than that for pregnancy lengths.
